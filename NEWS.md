# facthelpeR 0.3.0

* Added the `read_ods_multsheets()` function

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Edited `find_col_info()` to return a nice message instead of an error when there are no more invalid columns left to check.

* Fixed an issue in `read_multsheets()` where the guess_max argument was not used if the file type was csv.

* Added the `plot_map()` function to map the field layout of a single trial or all trials.
